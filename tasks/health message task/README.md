## Task Description
1. There were 3 types of health messages with the total number of 30. In addition, 3 types of control messages with the total number of 30 were included. Please see the stimuli document for a complete list of messages. Each of the how, why, risk message pair was matched by a theme (e.g., aging, cancer, diabetes)

    10 activity_how: how one could be more active and less sedentary
    
    10 activity_why: why one should be more active and less sedentary
    
    10 activity_risk: messages highlighting the risk of being sedentary and not active

    plus

    10 control_how: how one could do other daily activities unrelated to physical activity

    10 control_why: why one should do other daily activities unrelated to physical activity

    10 control_risk: messages highlighting the risk of doing or not doing other daily activities unrelated to physical activity 

2. In the Messages Task, all participants received 30 health messages and 30 control messages across two runs in even proportions in a randomized order. 

3. Participants were given a random selection of 10 risk messages from the pool of 16 risk messages.

4. Task timing for each message block
    1. Health message (8 s, pictogram and audio accompanied)
    2. Relevance rating (4 s, “Indicate how relevant each statement is to you, 1=not relevant-4=relevant”) 
    3. Blocks were separated by fixation rest periods (3 s); every fifth block contained a longer (12 s) block of rest.

5. The risk messages were presented on a single screen for 10 seconds with accompanying audio. 

6. For the full list of health messages, see [stimuli.csv](https://github.com/prateekshitcnlab/PhysicalActivity2/blob/master/tasks/health%20message%20task/stimuli.csv)
